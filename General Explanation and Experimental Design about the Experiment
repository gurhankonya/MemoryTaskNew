Unity VR

Dear Max and Farbod,

As you know, our group is formed by Carla, Thekla, Juwi, Friederich and Gürhan. Our aim was
to accomplish the tasks that you want us to do. In that sense, we want to develop an
experiment designed by Unity, aiming to test the capacity of working memory depending on
our previously conducted literature review.

To be able to get our experiment started, we were in need of some theoretical background
knowledge. The first thing we had to figure out was how many seconds or milliseconds we
were ought to wait after the representation of the digits. In an experiment conducted by
Norris(2017), the waiting time was only 1s after the representation of the digits.
Delay time after the representation of stimulus depends also what kind of results one
expects from the results of the experiment. The more you wait, the more you remember the
stimuli (Cowan, 2001).

Since our experiment was related to working memory, we came across the importance of
“chunking” which implies the capacity of working memory. According to Cowan(2004),
working memory capacity is approximately four items, which means that we are able to save
4 items and by rehearsal, we can make it to 6 items.
We aimed to find out the flexibility of the working memory capacity by increasing the items
up to 8. In the following, you can find the experimental design we used in order to develop
our experiment.

Experimental Design:
• In our experiment, we used the digits to see the capacity of working memory up to 8
items.
• Basically, Random numbers were displayed in the middle of a circle formed by
numbers from 0 to 9.
• We start with 5 digits and end with 8 digits.
• We had 4 blocks
• Every block had 2 tasks
• The representation of the stimulus and the time for answering was 3s. 

As a result,  we are happy with our experiment.

All of the group members participated the courses and followed the lectures carefully. 

We communicated to each other in every single step and tried to help one another. 

Since we are asked to give a grade for the whole group, we would like to mention something ; 
non of the students in this group were the experts of Unity or any kind of programming.

Thank is why,  we started from scratch and tried our best. From that reason, 
we would like to be graded by one of your best notes. 

We also would like to say "thank you" two, since you were really patient to us from the beginning.
